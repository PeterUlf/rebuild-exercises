## Title: Impossible Layout

### Rules

- You may make changes to "index.html"
- You may make changes to "css/style.css"

### Exercise description

In this exercise your job is to create a responsive layout, which goes from a two-column layout to a single-column layout controlled by a single media query rule. The `article`s with the classes of `.a` and `.b` are in the left column, and `.c`, `.d`, and `.e` are in the right column. The order of the `article` elements changes once the viewport is smaller than `40rem` (see video reference).
