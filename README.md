## Title: Card breakout

### Rules

- You may _NOT_ make changes to "index.html"
- You may only make changes to "css/style.css"

### Exercise description

In this exercise your job is to create a card component, in which the the image "breaks out" of the container. There are two layouts — one for small screens, and another for larger screens. On small screens the image sits on top, and on larger screens the image sits next to the text content. The maximum width of the card (including the image) is `1000px` (see video reference).
